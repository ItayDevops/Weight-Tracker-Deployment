# Weight-Tracker-Deployment
Terraform-Deployment-Infrastructure-Week5

This Terraform script is deploying the necessary infrastructure environment for the weight tracker app to work.
In this Script we will be deploying the following resources in order to make it work.
That includes:
3 Application virtual machines.
Load Balancer for the App VMs.
1 Database VM.
NSG for each environment
and Vnet with 2 subnets in it (one private and one public - for the app VMs).
